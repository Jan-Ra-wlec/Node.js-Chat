### General
this software is for experimental and maybe tutorial use only, not for professional or commercial use. Use it at your own risk! 

### Download
 - create a useful directory. to avoid confusion, not unter `/htdocs`, `/var/www/html`. Apache has not to deal with it!
 - `git clone <url> .`

### Install
`npm install` 

### Running
after installing, run `node server.js` on console, then point your browser(s) on your machine to 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and have fun! of course, you can change the port in *config.json*.
the app makes heavy use of *console.log()* both server- and clientside. throw it off if you wish. to shutdown the server app, hit [CTRL] C

### Usage
after login with a valid username, type text in the input bar, min. four char. click 'send' or hit Enter. for a PM, click a username in the lower left panel, which must appear red now. your messages go private now. to switch to public conversation, click again this user.

### Version
current version 0.9.0. check regular to see changes. chat working, but still with issues listed below. 

### Bugs/Issues
a few major issues to be fixed are:
 - sort the	multilingualism german/english
 - set some `settimeOut()` to avoid spamming
 - place some nice tooltips
 - LESS for Css, colors etc. (developer issue)
 - etc..
